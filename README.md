# GroceryList

A video presentation of the app's functionality is available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AN37YG7VOI).

At first, the user opens up the app to see a list of his grocery list and a button to add a new one. At the begininng the list is empty so he must go to create one.

Clicking on the ```ADD``` button opens up a new screen where the user can input the list's parameters. Each list is identified by a ```name```, has a deadline ```date``` to be bought, a ```priority``` and a ```location```.

Setting the location opens a new screen showing the user's location on the map, and providing a search bar with an auto-complete feature to search for places. Selecting such a place will set it as a grocery list location.

Once created, a grocery list can be clicked on to add groceries, it can be deleted with clicking on ```DONE``` meaning everything in it was bought, and it can be shared through email. Clicking on ```EMAIL``` opens up a system dialog for the user to pick an email application with which he wants to share the list.

Clicking on the list opens a new screen where the user can see the details of the groceries.

Each grocery item is described with a ```name``` and ```quantity```. The item can be marked as ```BOUGHT``` which effectively deletes it from the list. Grocery item name input has a auto-complete feature offering items from two online markets: [Tesco](https://devportal.tescolabs.com/) and Inrfood(https://www.inrfood.com/).
